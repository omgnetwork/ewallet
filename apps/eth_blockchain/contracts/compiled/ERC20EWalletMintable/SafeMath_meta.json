This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"./math/SafeMath.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"byzantium","libraries":{},"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"./math/SafeMath.sol":{"keccak256":"0x4ccf2d7b51873db1ccfd54ca2adae5eac3b184f9699911ed4490438419f1c690","urls":["bzzr://1604f5b6d6e916c154efd8c6720cda069e5ba32dfa0a9dedf2b42e5b02d07f89"]}},"version":1}
