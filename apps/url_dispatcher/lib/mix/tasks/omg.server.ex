  Starts the application by configuring all endpoints servers to run.

  ## Command line options

  This task accepts the same command-line arguments as `run`.

  `Mix.Tasks.Run`.

  For example, to run `omg.server` without checking dependencies:

      mix omg.server --no-deps-check

  The `--no-halt` flag is automatically added.

  ## OmiseGO-specific options

  This task can also be run with the following flags:

  - `--no-watch` - disables watching and building when frontend assets change
