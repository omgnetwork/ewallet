# ExternalLedgerDB

`ExternalLedgerDB` is the eWallet's sub-app that stores data from the external ledgers,
such as the Ethereum blockchain, so that data can be provided to other sub-apps efficiently.

This is a part of the eWallet umbrella app. You can start this sub-application
by starting the global umbrella application rather that this one specifically.
