# eWalletDB

eWalletDB (a.k.a the `EWalletDB` module in the code) is the eWallet's sub-app
that allows connectivity to the eWallet's database by other sub-apps.

This is a part of the eWallet umbrella app. You can start this sub-application
by starting the global umbrella application rather that this one specifically.
