# API Specifications

OpenAPI definitions, allow devs to specify the operations and metadata of their APIs in machine-readable form. This enables them to automate various processes around the API lifecycle.

OmiseGO provides two APIs (eWallet and Admin) and two definition which you can use to generate your client libraries.

### Development specs

In order to facilitate the development and maintenance of the API documentation, the open api spec is splat into multiple files.

These files are grouped under a resource and each resource has 5 spec files. The basic structure is as follow:
```
/swagger
  /resource1 (user for example)
    paths.yaml
    request_bodies.yaml
    response_schemas.yaml
    responses.yaml
    schemas.yaml
  /resource2
    paths.yaml
    request_bodies.yaml
    ...
  ...
```

Each of these file contain different part of the API definition.

When developing you should modify these files, under the `swagger` folder and NOT directly the `spec.yaml` or `spec.json` which are automatically generated.

### Generating the final spec file

When you are done editing the different spec files, you need to generate the final spec file which group all specifications together into one `"big"` file.

In order to do this you need to have the following installed and available:
  - [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
  - [swagger-combine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-combine). Install using: `npm install -g swagger-combine`.

Then you need to run the following commands to generate the final spec.

**eWallet API:**

```
swagger-combine apps/ewallet_api/priv/swagger/swagger.yaml -o apps/ewallet_api/priv/spec.yaml &&
swagger-combine apps/ewallet_api/priv/swagger/swagger.yaml -o apps/ewallet_api/priv/spec.json
```

**Admin API:**

```
swagger-combine apps/admin_api/priv/swagger/swagger.yaml -o apps/admin_api/priv/spec.yaml &&
swagger-combine apps/admin_api/priv/swagger/swagger.yaml -o apps/admin_api/priv/spec.json
```
