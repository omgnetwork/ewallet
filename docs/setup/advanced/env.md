# Environment Variables

## General

Below are the general environment variables needed for the eWallet to run.

- `MIX_ENV`: Environment in which the application is being ran. `prod` for production.
- `BASE_URL`: The base to use when building URLs.
- `PORT`: The port that the application listens on.
- `EWALLET_SECRET_KEY`: Encryption key used to encrypt some data in the database.
- `LOCAL_LEDGER_SECRET_KEY`: Encryption key used to encrypt some data in the database.

To generate a new secret key using Elixir:

```
$ elixir -e "IO.puts 32 |> :crypto.strong_rand_bytes() |> Base.encode64()"
8I_xIED7p7ruxxM1vNiWzsud3DALk0cnpcAncC2YyMs
```

## Database

The eWallet needs access to two different databases: one for the eWallet itself and one for the local ledger. The following environment variables need to be set.

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `LOCAL_LEDGER_DATABASE_URL`

## Incoming Requests

The eWallet allows you to configure different aspects of the incoming requests.
We try to provide sane default values, but if needed, the following environment variables are configurable:

- `REQUEST_MAX_PER_PAGE`: The maximum value of `per_page` a request can make. This helps prevent requests from overloading the system by sending a very high `per_page` value.

## Standalone eWallet

The eWallet is able to work independent of an external integration. The default configurations expect the eWallet to be integrated with another system, but the following environment variables can be configured:

- `ENABLE_STANDALONE`: Enables standalone mode such as `/api/client/user.signup`, `/api/client/user.verify_email` and `/api/client/user.login` so that the eWallet can be used without integration with other systems. Set `ENABLE_STANDALONE=true` to enable the feature.

## External redirects

Some features such as email verification allows redirects to URIs external to the eWallet. For security reasons we do not allow redirects to arbitary URIs, unless the prefix is whitelisted.

- `REDIRECT_URL_PREFIXES`: A comma-separated list of prefixes that are allowed to be redirected to. For example, `REDIRECT_URL_PREFIXES=https://example.com,pos-client://example.com` allows redirects to `https://example.com/some_url` and `pos-client://example.com/some_deep_linked_url`.

## Error Reporting

The eWallet only supports [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) for now. You can specify the DSN for it with the following environment variable:

- `SENTRY_DSN`

## Balance Caching

The local ledger offers a caching mechanism for wallets in order to boost the calculation speed (in case you have millions of transactions). To enable this feature, set the `BALANCE_CACHING_FREQUENCY` environment variable and pass it a valid CRON schedule. Note that this is totally optional and the application will work fine without it.

- `BALANCE_CACHING_FREQUENCY`: A valid CRON schedule.

Examples:

- Every minute: `"* * * * *"`
- Every day at 2 am: `"0 2 * * *"`
- Every Friday at 5 am: `"0 5 * * 5"`

If this feature is enabled, you can also specify a caching strategy.

- `BALANCE_CACHING_STRATEGY`: Specify if new cached wallets should be computed using a previous cache or by recalculating everything from scratch.

Strategies available:

- `since_beginning`: Recalculate the balance since the beginning of time.
- `since_last_cached`: Use the last cached balance, adds the transactions that happened since and saves the result in a new cached balance.

## Emails

To enable emails in the eWallet (for forget password or inviting admins), you'll need to set the following environment variables:

- `SENDER_EMAIL`: The email address to appear as the sender.
- `SMTP_HOST`: Your email server domain name.
- `SMTP_PORT`: The port used to connect to your email server.
- `SMTP_USER`: Identifier to use your email server.
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: Password for email server.

## File Upload

- `FILE_STORAGE_ADAPTER`: (`local`|`aws`|`gcs`, defaults to `local`)

In order to use the file upload feature (for profile pictures and account logos), environment variables need to be defined.

### Local File Storage

Nothing else to set, files will be stored at the root of the project in `public/uploads/`.

### Amazon S3

- `AWS_BUCKET`: The name of your S3 bucket.
- `AWS_REGION`: The region in which your bucket lives.
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret key.

### Google Cloud Storage

- `GCS_BUCKET`: Your GCS bucket.
- `GCS_CREDENTIALS`: A JSON containing your GCS credentials.

### E2E Tests

- `E2E_ENABLED`: Allows to run `mix seed --test --yes` to generate test data
- `E2E_TEST_ADMIN_EMAIL`: The email of the first test admin
- `E2E_TEST_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: The password of the first test admin
- `E2E_TEST_ADMIN_1_EMAIL`: The email of the second test admin
- `E2E_TEST_ADMIN_1_PASSWORD`: The password of the second test admin
