# Upgrading from `v1.1.0` to `v1.2.0`

## Prerequisites

Please perform the upgrade as described in [Upgrading the eWallet Server](README.md)
before proceeding below.

## Changes

The biggest change introduced in 1.2.0 is the removal of the hierarchy system for accounts. The new system is based on a flat approach where every account is equal and each admin users needs to be explicitly added to it. If you've run the migration command shown in the [Readme](README.md), you should be good to go since your data should have been moved around while the database structure was changed.
