## Deploying the OmiseGO SDK

OmiseGO offers hosting solutions for the OmiseGO SDK. [Get in touch](mailto:thibault@omise.co) if you're interested.

Deploying the OmiseGO SDK can be done on any infrastructure. For security reasons, it is recommended to run the applications on one server and the databases on a different one.

More information about deployment will be available soon.
