# OmiseGO eWallet

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.omisego.io/buildStatus/icon?job=omisego/ewallet/master)](https://jenkins.omisego.io/blue/organizations/jenkins/omisego%2Fewallet/activity?branch=master) [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/omisego/ewallet.png)](https://gitter.im/omisego/ewallet)

This is the server component of the OmiseGO eWallet that allows businesses and individuals (referred hereafter as the "provider") to setup and run their own digital wallet services through their own local ledger.

This server component and its sibling SDKs will later be plugged onto a blockchain and connected to a decentralized exchange. **Blockchain capabilities are expected to be added as they become ready.** All active instances of the OmiseGO eWallet will then become a federated network forming the top layer of the OMG network, allowing the exchange of any currency into any other in a transparent way.

The SDKs for integrating your apps with the eWallet are available in [Ruby](https://github.com/omisego/ruby-sdk) ([sample server](https://github.com/omisego/sample-server)), [iOS](https://github.com/omisego/ios-sdk) ([sample app](https://github.com/omisego/sample-ios)) and [Android](https://github.com/omisego/android-sdk) ([sample app](https://github.com/omisego/sample-android)).

## Overview

Here is an overview of all the eWallet components and what needs to be integrated by a provider.

![A provider's Sample Setup](assets/provider_setup.jpg)

## Getting started

Pick one of the following setup approaches that best suits your needs:

Setup | Description | Recommended for
-----------|-------------|----------------
[Docker](docs/setup/docker.md) | A pre-packaged image for production uses. No build-time dependencies. Packaged with Distillery. | Developers and DevOps looking to integrate or deploy the eWallet without changing its internals.
[Bare&#x2011;metal](docs/setup/bare_metal.md) | Set up directly onto your base operating system. You will need to install Elixir, project's dependencies and Postgres manually if you havn't. | Developers and DevOps preferring to manage all dependencies and configurations themselves for any purposes.

## Documentation

Below are the links to the HTTP-RPC API documentations for the `master` branch. Note that the eWallet is not a centralized service and **the servers below are not for production uses.**

- Admin API ([**interactive**](https://ewallet.staging.omisego.io/api/admin/docs.ui) / [**yaml**](https://ewallet.staging.omisego.io/api/admin/docs.yaml) / [**json**](https://ewallet.staging.omisego.io/api/admin/docs.json)): Integrate with your server apps to perform higher-privilege operations, such as managing tokens, accounts, users, transactions, global settings, etc.
- Client API ([**interactive**](https://ewallet.staging.omisego.io/api/client/docs.ui) / [**yaml**](https://ewallet.staging.omisego.io/api/client/docs.yaml) / [**json**](https://ewallet.staging.omisego.io/api/client/docs.json)): Integrate with your client apps to transact on behalf of a specific user, such as creating a transaction request for a specific user, updating a user's settings, etc.

We also provide the [**Ruby SDK**](https://github.com/omisego/ruby-sdk) ([sample server](https://github.com/omisego/sample-server)), [**iOS SDK**](https://github.com/omisego/ios-sdk) ([sample app](https://github.com/omisego/sample-ios)) and [**Android SDK**](https://github.com/omisego/android-sdk) ([sample app](https://github.com/omisego/sample-android)) so you do not have to deal with the HTTP-RPC layer yourself.

Optionally, deeper dives into the eWallet are available:
