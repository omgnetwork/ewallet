## How to contribute to the OmiseGO's projects

Welcome to one of OmiseGO's open source projects! We welcome contributions in all kinds and shapes: code, documentation, bug reports, feedbacks... But before opening your first issue or PR, please read through this document.

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* __Do not create issues for security vulnerabilities__. We are currently setting up a bounty program for those. In the meantime, you can get in touch with us via [email](thibault@omisego.co).
* For other bugs, first, ensure that the bug you found has not been reported yet. To do so, you can [search under issues](https://github.com/omisego/ewallet/issues).
* Open a new issue if you didn't find an existing one. Follow the issue template and be as specific as possible.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a Pull Request.
* Describe the problem and solution. Add link to issue if any.
* Read the [coding conventions](docs/conventions.md).

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Do not open an issue right away. First, get in touch with us through [Rocket Chat](https://chat.omisego.network/channel/ewallet-sdk). Once you get the green light to work on something, create an issue to describe the whole idea.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* You can ask any question about the source code in the [Rocket Chat](https://chat.omisego.network/channel/ewallet-sdk) or on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

Thanks!
